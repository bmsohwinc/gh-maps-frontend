## gh-navigator
View your and other's GitHub connections a little easily! [Try it out LIVE](https://gh-maps-frontend.vercel.app/)!

## Why gh-navigator?
While you can view followers and following (collectively, connections) profiles on GitHub, they are not neatly presented in a single page, and needs several clicks and page visits.\
With gh-navigator, you'll have all connections listed on a single page, with a support for history of profiles you visited as well as quick stats that help you discover connections more easily.

## Top features
1. **Single page** to view all connections of any user
2. Quick **user stats** for easier discovery
3. **Search history** for easier trace-back
4. Create **search lists** for future reference

## Local setup
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
