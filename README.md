# gh-navigator
View your and other's GitHub connections a little easily! [Try it out LIVE](https://gh-maps-frontend.vercel.app/)!

## Why gh-navigator?
Without a central page for user connections, searching users and their projects on GitHub is a little hard, requiring multiple clicks and page visits.\
With **gh-navigator**, you can access _any_ user's connections on a single page, with local history tracking, as well as create profile lists.

## Top features
1. **Single page** to view all connections of any user
2. Quick **user stats** for easier discovery
3. **Search history** for easier trace-back
4. Create **search lists** for future reference

## Local setup
1. Frontend (this repository)
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
2. Companion Backend repository [here](https://github.com/bmsohwinc/gh-maps-backend)

## Tech stack
1. Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript
2. Frameworks: Next JS, React JS
3. Libraries: Material UI, Immer JS
